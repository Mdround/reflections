When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- For backup; to share it with others; to brag.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- I might want to test things locally, or make several related changes, before making a change to a collaborative project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- forks - when I want to adapt someone else's work
- clones - when I want to copy a repo to a local machine
- branches - when I want to work on the code without (immediately) changing the master
