When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- For backup; to share it with others; to brag.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- I might want to test things locally, or make several related changes, before making a change to a collaborative project.
