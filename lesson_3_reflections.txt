When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- For backup; to share it with others; to brag.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- I might want to test things locally, or make several related changes, before making a change to a collaborative project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- forks - when I want to adapt someone else's work
- clones - when I want to copy a repo to a local machine
- branches - when I want to work on the code without (immediately) changing the master

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- The ability to know whether you can push without having to merge first?

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
- When experimenting with a feature, where I might want to keep that experiment from interfering with the working code in the master
- When collaborating with others, where I might want to demonstrate that the branch works, before persuading someone to update the master with it.
